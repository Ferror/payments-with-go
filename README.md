# payments-with-go

Payments API written in GO. Daily I work with PHP and you may know, that it's a interpreted language.
GO on the other hand is compiled language. Just for fun I will try to create a simple payments API to learn how
everything works.

## Usage

Just run `docker compose up -d`, then open `localhost` in your browser
